fancy-doc-viewer
============

## What
Polymer-style docs for your own site.

## Motivation
I've never been happy with my own docs. They are a pain to maintain,
and the payoff comes 6 months later: "Did I really write this?"

`fancy-doc-viewer` is useful right away. It combines your component docs with docs
for all the other components used by your project, plus your txt and markdown docs.
